# To Do App

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my To Do App! This app was built using React and allows you to add, edit, and delete tasks.

## Getting Started

To use this app, you can either clone the repository or [view it live on Vercel](https://doyourwork.vercel.app/).

### Cloning the Repository

1.  Click on the green "Code" button and copy the HTTPS link.
2.  Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3.  Run the command `git clone <HTTPS link>` (without the angle brackets).
4.  Navigate into the cloned directory and run the command `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. 
5.  Finally, run the command `npm start` to start the development server.

## Using the App
